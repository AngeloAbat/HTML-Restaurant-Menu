        <h1>Origin Story</h1>
        <h3>This small restaurant all started with a man who loved to cook based on the traditional food of Thailand. He learned how to cook all these food like Fresh Rolls and Chicken Satay from his mother. So his love for cooking grew and grew. As he cook more he learned new ways to add his specialty into the dishes Once he was old enough he decided to make a restaurant based on his Thai cooking. Even his wife makes all the Thai desserts for his restaurant. So this became a big family restaurant.
